Ride-Sharing System
A C# console application demonstrating object-oriented programming principles through a real-world ride-sharing platform.

Overview
This system allows passengers to request rides, drivers to accept them, and administrators to manage the platform using inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, LINQ, and exception handling.

Core Features
User Management: Register as passenger/driver with role-based menus
Ride Requests: Location-based matching using LINQ filtering
Payment System: Virtual wallet with distance-based pricing
Rating System: Post-ride driver ratings with performance tracking

Technical Implementation
OOP Concepts
Inheritance: Base User class â†’ Passenger/Driver classes
Interfaces: IPayable for behavioral contracts
Polymorphism: Role-specific method implementations
LINQ: Driver filtering, data queries, statistical analysis
Menu Structure
Main: Register, Login, Exit
Passenger: Request ride, view wallet, add funds, rate driver
Driver: View requests, accept/complete rides, view earnings

Getting Started
Open in Visual Studio/VS Code
Build and run the console application
Register as passenger or driver
